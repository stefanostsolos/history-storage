1. Small Configuration (2000 RAM Capacity):

a) H94L80:
   - Write Speed: 52,667.56 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 311,191.05 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 1700/48300
   - Total flushes: 161

b) H97L84:
   - Write Speed: 45,451.57 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 283,536.72 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 1715/48285
   - Total flushes: 185

c) H98L90:
   - Write Speed: 38,916.50 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 315,497.22 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 1940/48060
   - Total flushes: 267

Analysis: For the small configuration, lower watermarks performed better in terms of write speed. However, the highest watermark (H98L90) kept slightly more entries in RAM. The number of flushes increased significantly with higher watermarks, which negatively impacted write performance.

2. Medium Configuration (5000 RAM Capacity):

a) H94L80:
   - Write Speed: 63,120.79 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 271,282.08 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 4250/45750
   - Total flushes: 61

b) H97L84:
   - Write Speed: 64,245.22 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 348,779.62 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 4430/45570
   - Total flushes: 70

c) H98L90:
   - Write Speed: 61,181.84 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 327,175.88 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 4550/45450
   - Total flushes: 101

Analysis: The medium configuration showed more balanced results. H97L84 performed best overall, with the highest write and read speeds. Higher watermarks increased the number of entries kept in RAM but also increased the number of flushes.

3. Large Configuration (10000 RAM Capacity):

a) H94L80:
   - Write Speed: 78,998.80 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 346,687.75 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 9500/40500
   - Total flushes: 27

b) H97L84:
   - Write Speed: 78,968.23 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 365,539.83 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 9669/40331
   - Total flushes: 31

c) H98L90:
   - Write Speed: 79,352.74 entries/second
   - Read Speed: 322,364.35 entries/second
   - Final RAM/DB split: 9500/40500
   - Total flushes: 45

Analysis: For the large configuration, all settings performed similarly in terms of write speed. H97L84 had the best read speed, while H98L90 had slightly better write speed but at the cost of more flushes.

Overall observations:
1. Larger RAM capacities consistently provided better write and read speeds across all watermark settings.
2. The impact of watermark settings varies with RAM capacity, but generally, higher watermarks lead to more flushes and slightly more entries kept in RAM.
3. For smaller RAM capacities, lower watermarks performed better in write operations due to fewer flushes.
4. The medium configuration with H97L84 settings showed a good balance between performance and RAM utilization.
5. The large configuration performances were more closely grouped, suggesting that with larger RAM, the watermark settings have less impact on overall performance.
6. Read speeds were generally more variable than write speeds across configurations.

Recommendations:
1. For systems with limited RAM (small configuration), use lower watermarks (H94L80) to prioritize write speed.
2. For balanced systems (medium configuration), the H97L84 setting offers the best overall performance.
3. For systems with ample RAM (large configuration), H97L84 or H98L90 both perform well, with a slight edge to H97L84 for read operations.
4. If minimizing the number of flushes is a priority, lower watermarks are preferable, especially for smaller RAM capacities.

In conclusion, for handling 50,000 entries, the medium configuration with H97L84 settings or the large configuration with either H97L84 or H98L90 settings appear to be the most efficient, providing a good balance of write speed, read speed, and RAM utilization. The choice between these would depend on the specific priorities of the system (e.g., favoring read or write operations) and the available RAM.
